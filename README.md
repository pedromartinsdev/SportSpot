# Routes

## Index (/)

The `/` route checks if a user is logged in. If there is a logged-in user, it redirects to the `/home` route. If there is no logged-in user, it renders the `/landing-page`.

## /landing-page

This route renders a landing page promoting the app.

## /create-user

This route renders a register page.

In this route, the user fills in their information for registration.
It's important to note that all fields are mandatory, except for the photo link.

Before allowing a new user to be created, a database query is performed to check if the ```username``` and ```email``` are already in use.

## /password

This route renders a "Forgot Password" page that prompts the user to enter their email address to receive a password reset link.

## /login

This route renders a login page where the user must enter their email and password, or click on the "Forgot Password" and "Create Account" links. f the email and password are correct, it will render the app's ```/home``` page. If they are incorrect, a flash message will appear with the text "Invalid email or password."

## /home

The `/home` route renders a page that displays all the events you are subscribed to and all the events you have created.

Observations:
- This route uses the `layout.html` template for the header, navigation (nav), and footer.
- This route requires login (`@login_required`) to access.

## /create-event

This route allows for creating an event and is triggered by the "New Event" button on the Events page.

All fields are required to be filled in, including event `title`, `description`, `cost`, `location`, `date`, and `time`.
